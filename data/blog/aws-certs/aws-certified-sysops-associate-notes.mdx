## IAM: users and Groups

### Root user

- The user created when the AWS account is created
- The credentials are the email & password used when signing up for the AWS account
- By default, the root user has full administrative rights & access to every part of the account

### Best practices for the root user

- We should not use the root user for daily work & administration
  - another account that has admin rights should be used
- The root user account should not access keys. Delete them if they exist
- The root user should use MFA

### IAM User

- A new user has an implicit deny for all AWS services and requires a policy be added to grant them access
- Users receive unique credentials (username, password & access keys)
- Users can have IAM policies applied directly to them, or they can be a member of a group that has policies attached
- With policies, an explicit deny always overrides an explicit allow from attached policies
  - for instance, AWS will ignore all policies attached to a user if a single deny-all policy is added

#### Best practices for users

- Never store or "pass" your credentials to EC2 instances - use SSH forwarding
- MFA can and should be used for users' accounts
- Access credentials are unique and should never be shared

### IAM Groups

- Allow for policy assignments to multiple users at the same time
- We may assign permission to a group
- More organized and efficient way's to manage users and policies
- Cannot be nested
- Users may be the members of multiple groups

#### Rest practices for groups

- Organize users by functions
- Assign IAM policies to groups, not individual users

### IAM policies

- A document that states one or more permissions (JSON formatted)
- An explicit deny always overrides an explicit allow.
- This allows for the users of a deny-all policy to quickly restricts all access a user may have

#### Managed policies

- AWS provides pre-built policy templates to assign to users & groups
- Examples include:
  - Administrator access: Full access to all AWS resources
  - Power-user access: Admin access, except it does not allow user/group management
  - Read-only access: Only view AWS resources (e.g., user can only view what is in S3 buckets)

#### Custom policies

- You can create custom IAM policies using the policy generator or write them from scratch
- More than one policy can be attached to a user/group at the same time
- Policies can not be directly attached to AWS resources (such as an EC2 instance)

### IAM Roles

- Temporary security credentials in AWS managed by Security Token Service (STS)
- Another entity can assume the specific permissions defined by the Roles
- These entities include:
  - AWS resources (e.g., EC2 instance)
  - A user outside of AWS needs temporary access

#### Roles with AWS services

- We must use role because policies cannot be attached directly to AWS resources
- Services can only have one role attached at a time
- You should never pass or store credentials to an EC2 instance - instead, use role
- You may change the role of running EC2 instances through the console or URI

#### Other uses of Roles

- Cross-account access (delegation)
  - Provide access to another AWS account from another account
